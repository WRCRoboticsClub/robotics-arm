All the materials used and taken from Robotics club are listed here:
1. Ply
2. Aluminium
3. Stepper Motor (x4)
4. Gripper with Servo (x1)
5. Servo Motor (x1)
6. Arduino (From Sachin Giri)
7. Arduino Cable (From Sunil Shah)
8. 4 channel relay (x2) (Will not work because we will need atleaset 2 relays to control a stepper motor to move forward and backward, so that will be a lot of relays to connect within a circuit)
9. Arduino Shield (x2)


To be consider in near future:
1. Replace 2 arduino with single microprocessor
2. Convert whole arm to 3d printed
