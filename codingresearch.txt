# ROBOTIC ARM

# RESEARCH ON CODING 
 
# REQUIRED SOFTWARE :

 1. Python
 2. Pyserial
 2. Arduino IDE
 3. Open cv(For image processing)

- BASIC WORKLFLOW

> The code for arduino pin inputs will be written in arduino IDE.
> The code for basic movements and rotation of servo motors in robotic arm will be written in python.
> Install Pyserial for serial communication between arduino and python.
> OpenCV is a Python open-source library for computer vision in object recognization which will be used later on the program code.

'Code will be uploaded soon.'
