Robotic Arm

Introduction:

A robotic arm is a mechanical, programmable mobile device that's used to manipulate objects like a human arm.
This project is done to demonstrate in the upcoming competition outside of WRC.
Under the leadership of Sunil Shah dai, five general members i.e. Soniya Karki, Ajay Oli, Sumit Babu Rijal, Barsha KC and Pratham Adhikari worked on this project.

Components:

Servo Motor
Stepper Motor
Jumper Wires
Gears
Bearings
Arduino
Battery
Pins/Screws
Wheels
Motor Driver
3D Printed Parts

Process:

Firstly, a model design of how the project should look like is work in progress in solidworks.
The design is being simulated and motion studied.
The design should be made with scratch materials like woods and metals to test the efficiency first and then only with the 3D printed parts; it is recommended.

Problem Faced While Making the Arm:

The designing process on solidworks was very complex as I was a beginner on Solidworks.
Lack of time management.

Conclusion:

I learned a lot about the features of solidworks while making the design.
Although it was driving me crazy about how to fix the design, I was getting more experience on working with solidworks.
You should always do deep research about what you are going to make beforehand.
Also, you shouldnâ€™t panic while working and should consult the mentor/project leader instantly if any problem arises.
Importantly, never forget to take a break and chill if things take a wrong turn.
